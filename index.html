                <p><strong> Hello! Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio.</strong> I am pleased that you are interested in learning a bit about me, and happy to oblige. <br><br>
    
               As of now I am just beginning as a web developer, having completed a three month full-stack web development bootcamp at the University of Denver. Although this was a fairly short program it was very time and labor intensive and I can confidently say I am ready for a junior position as a web developer - <strong>I have more to learn (hopefully always will), but I am a skilled student and researcher and ready to continue on the job. </strong> So, I am looking for a company that is willing to take me on in return for my sincere efforts to grow as an asset to their team. As a part of a team I offer creativity and a dynamic perspective, an openness to influencing and being influenced by others, persistence, and reliable equanimity. In the meantime, I am exploring opportunities to volounteer code, and collaborating on projects with my friends from the DU program.
    
               Initially I was attracted to software development and information technology because it is vibrantly alive and the applications seem diverse and endless, as do the career opportunities.<strong> I have discovered that I am indirectly <i>passionate</i> about code</strong>  because curiosity is a fundamental part of my being, a core value, and you could say that this particular art and science lends itself <i>very adequately</i> to the purpose of increasing ones awareness of the world. As well as assisting others with acquiring greater awareness for themselves. The field of <strong>data visualization is particularly interesting to me</strong> and where I am currently focusing my personal efforts.<br><br>
    
               Please enjoy my portfolio. And please remember to take in to account that although new to this particular field of work, I have a decade of good work behind me in my previous career and am <strong>no stranger to adversity, challenge, the nature of perseverance, or success. </strong>While I am eager, I am also interested in a good fit. I think patience and persistence yield the best results the fastest on average.
